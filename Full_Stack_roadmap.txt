Full stack roadmap MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Nodejs)Stack

Frontend
	HTML
	CSS
	JavaScript (Your JS strength will determine the package)
	Git & Github (Code versioning and working with other developers)
	React (Just few lines of React code = 100s of lines of HTML, CSS and JS code)
	
Backend
	Nodejs (It's something that runs JavaScript code. It's like Dotnet or JVM/JDK)
	HTTP (Let language of the internet)
	Rest API development
	Database (MongoDB)

DevOps
	Github PRs: How to do opensource/general contribution?
	Code review strategy: Checklists, code linters and code formatters
	Building: webpack, Babel, Typescript
	Deployment: Github pages, Netlify and Heroku
	

End Goal: To understand full stack development!
