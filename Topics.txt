3 most omportant things about CSS

    1. CSS can be added in 3 ways i.e Inline, Internal and External CSS.
    2. Among all the above ways, inline styling has the highest priority.
    3. Inside <head> tag, lower <style> or CSS <Link> will have higher priority.

    inline > internal, external

Pros/Cons of all three CSS techniques

    Inline
        Pros: Highest prioriy, CSS is close to HTML
        Con: Too much Inline CSS will make code convule

    Internal
        Pros: CSS stays in same file as html and no extra HTTP request is made for that style.css file
        Cons: It makes the HTML file big

    External: 
        Pros: CSS stays in separate file so its the most manageable way of writing CSS
        Con: We ll have to make a separate request for CSS file.
